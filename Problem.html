    <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Many students struggle to concentrate on studying and completing schoolwork at home for various reasons, resulting in a need for finding alternate locations to be productive. Students seeking study locations that remain open during the evenings will gain the most advantages, as many places close early, and donâ€™t accommodate for late hours. Our team proposes a web application that returns to the user a list of places open for studying, collaborating, to address the problem. </p>
